# Typing Test App

A React app for doing typing tests in different programming languages. The
purpose is twofold: I wanted to improve my React skills and get better at
typing since I noticed I was not using my pinkies as much as I could.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React
App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Install

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/MisanthropicBit/typing-test-app
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```

Run `yarn typecheck` to run the TypeScript compiler and typecheck the code.

Run `yarn test` to run all tests and launch the test runner in interactive watch mode.

Run `yarn build` to build the app for production in the `build` folder. It
correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes and minifies the build
for the best performance.
